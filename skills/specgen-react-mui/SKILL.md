  Generate a detailed specification document for building a React SPA (Single Page
  Application) using React 19, TypeScript 5, Vite 6, Material UI (MUI) v6, React Router v7,
  TanStack Query v5, Zustand v5, React Hook Form v7, and Zod v3. Authentication (Keycloak
  OAuth2/OIDC PKCE, generic OIDC, or none), API integration (REST via Axios), and optional
  features (WebSocket, i18n, MUI X Data Grid, MUI X Charts) are configurable based on user
  input.
  Standardized input: application name (mandatory), version (mandatory), module (optional).
  Use this skill whenever the user asks to create a spec, specification, blueprint, or
  technical design document for a new React SPA or frontend application.
  Also trigger when the user says things like "spec out a new React project",
  "design a React SPA", "write a technical spec for my new frontend app",
  "scaffold spec for a React MUI app", or any request for a specification document
  describing a React + MUI + TypeScript application. Even if the user only mentions
  a subset of the stack (e.g., "React SPA" or "React with Keycloak" or "React MUI dashboard"),
  this skill likely applies — ask and confirm.

# React SPA Specification Generator

This skill generates a comprehensive specification document (Markdown) that serves as a
blueprint for building a React Single Page Application. The spec is intended to be followed
by a developer or a coding agent to produce a fully functional project scaffold.

The specification does NOT generate code. It produces a detailed, opinionated technical
document describing every layer of the application — from Vite configuration to MUI theme
to React Query patterns — so that implementation becomes a mechanical exercise.

## Technology Stack

### Core Stack (Always Included)

These are the fixed versions the spec targets. Do not deviate unless the user explicitly
requests different versions.

| Component            | Version   |
|----------------------|-----------|
| React                | 19.x      |
| TypeScript           | 5.x       |
| Vite                 | 6.x       |
| Material UI (MUI)    | 6.x       |
| MUI Icons            | 6.x       |
| MUI System           | 6.x       |

| Node.js              | 22.x LTS  |

### Optional Integration Versions

Include in the version table only when the corresponding integration is selected.

| Component            | Version   | When Selected          |
|----------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Keycloak             | 26.x      | Auth = Keycloak        |
| oidc-client-ts       | 3.x       | Auth = Keycloak or OIDC|
| react-oidc-context   | 3.x       | Auth = Keycloak or OIDC|
| MUI X Data Grid      | 7.x       | DataGrid = yes         |
| MUI X Charts         | 7.x       | Charts = yes           |

## When the Skill Triggers

Generate the spec when the user provides an **application name** and **version** that
corresponds to one of the custom applications defined in `CLAUDE.md`. The skill
reads all required inputs from the project's context files — no interactive Q&A is needed
for the core inputs.

The user invokes this skill by specifying the target application and version, for example:
- `/specgen-react-mui admin v1.0.4`
- `/specgen-react-mui admin v1.0.4 module:Hero Section`
- `/specgen-react-mui "Admin Portal" v1.0.4`

The skill then locates the matching context folder and reads all input files automatically.

## Version Gate

Before starting any work, check `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root:

1. If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, skip this check (first-ever execution).
2. If `CHANGELOG.md` exists, scan all `## vX.Y.Z` headings and determine the **highest version** using semantic versioning comparison.
3. Compare the requested version against the highest version:
   - If requested version **>=** highest version: proceed normally.
   - If requested version **<** highest version: **STOP immediately**. Print: `"Version {requested} is lower than the current project version {highest} recorded in CHANGELOG.md. Execution rejected."` Do NOT proceed with any work.

## Input Resolution

This skill uses standardized input resolution. Provide:

| Argument | Required | Example | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<application>` | Yes | `admin` | Application name to locate the context folder |
| `<version>` | Yes | `v1.0.4` | Version to scope processing |
| `module:<name>` | No | `module:Hero Section` | Limit generation to a single module |

### Application Folder Resolution

The application name is matched against root-level application folders:
1. Strip any leading `<number>_` prefix from folder names (e.g., `1_admin` → `admin`)
2. Match case-insensitively against the provided application name
3. Accept snake_case, kebab-case, or title-case input (all match the same folder)
4. If no match found, list available applications and stop

### Auto-Resolved Paths

| File | Resolved Path |
|------|---------------|
| PRD.md | `<app_folder>/context/PRD.md` |
| Module Models | `<app_folder>/context/model/` |
| HTML Mockups | `<app_folder>/context/mockup/` |
| Output (specification) | `<app_folder>/context/specification/` |

### Version Filtering

When a version is provided, only include user stories, NFRs, and constraints from versions
<= the provided version. For example, if `v1.0.4` is specified:
- Include items tagged `[v1.0.0]`, `[v1.0.1]`, `[v1.0.2]`, `[v1.0.3]`, `[v1.0.4]`
- Exclude items tagged `[v1.0.5]` or later
- Version comparison uses semantic versioning order

### Module Filtering

When `module:<name>` is provided:
- Only generate the `SPEC.md` for that specific module
- Other existing module spec files remain untouched
- `SPECIFICATION.md` (root) gets a partial update — only that module's entry in the TOC
  is added or updated; all other TOC entries are preserved as-is

## Gathering Input

The specification is driven by **six input sources** read from the project's context files.
The skill does NOT ask the user for auth, API backend URL, or optional component choices —
it **determines** these automatically from the context.

### Input 1: Application Name (from CLAUDE.md)

From CLAUDE.md (already loaded in context), locate the target application under the
**Custom Applications** section. Extract:

- **Application name**: The section heading (e.g., "Admin Portal", "Landing Page")
- **Application description**: The description paragraph below the heading
- **Dependencies**: The "Depends on" list — primary source for determining backend API
  base URL, authentication provider, and optional components

The application name is used to derive:
- **Project slug**: Kebab-case of the application name (e.g., `admin-portal`)
- **Vite env prefix**: `VITE_` (standard Vite convention)
- **App title**: Title-case of application name (e.g., "Admin Portal")

### Input 2: User Stories (from PRD.md)

Read `<app_folder>/context/PRD.md`. This file contains all user stories organized by
module. Extract:

- **System modules**: Modules under `# System Module` heading (e.g., Authentication,
  User Management). These become system-level features.
- **Business modules**: Modules under `# Business Module` heading (e.g., Hero Section,
  Product and Service). These become business-level features.
- **User stories per module**: Each `### User Story` section contains tagged items.
  These define the functional requirements for each feature's API hooks, form schemas,
  and page components.

The user stories directly inform:
- Which API calls each feature's hooks must expose
- Which pages and routes are needed
- Which form fields and validation schemas apply
- Which MUI components best match the described UI

**Important:** Items with strikethrough (`~~text~~`) are deprecated — do NOT include them
as active requirements. List them in the "Removed / Replaced" subsection of the
traceability table.

- **Version tags per item**: Each `### User Story`, `### Non Functional Requirement`,
  and `### Constraint` section contains one or more version blocks formatted as `[v1.0.x]`.
  The skill must track the version tag for each item and carry it through to the
  generated specification's traceability section.

### Input 3: Non-Functional Requirements (from PRD.md)

Within the same `PRD.md`, each module has a `### Non Functional Requirement` section.
These inform:

- UI layout choices (grid columns, card sizes, image dimensions)
- Data fetching strategies (pagination, filtering, real-time)
- Validation rules (character limits, format requirements)
- Performance constraints (lazy loading, caching)

NFRs should be mapped to specific technical decisions in the spec — for example, an NFR
stating "paginated with 10 items per page" confirms which React Query pagination pattern
to use, while "must support filtering" confirms which Zustand slice manages filter state.

### Input 4: Constraints (from PRD.md)

Within the same `PRD.md`, each module has a `### Constraint` section. These define
hard boundaries that the spec must enforce:

- Status enum values (e.g., "DRAFT, ACTIVE, EXPIRED")
- Business rules (e.g., "category must exist before creating content")
- Access control (e.g., "only ADMIN role can access user management")

Constraints are embedded directly into the relevant module blueprint — they inform
Zod validation schemas, API call parameters, and route guard configurations.

### Input 5: Module Model (from model/ folder)

Read `<app_folder>/context/model/MODEL.md` first as the index, then read the
individual module model files in each module subfolder.

**MODEL.md** provides:
- Summary table of all modules with table/collection counts and design decisions
- Links to each module's detailed model files

**Per-module files** (e.g., `model/hero-section/model.md`):
- Complete field definitions with types and constraints
- Relationships and references
- Table/collection names

**Per-module schema** (e.g., `model/hero-section/schemas.json`):
- JSON schemas defining exact field types, required fields, and validation rules

The module model directly maps to:
- TypeScript interface/type definitions (field-for-field, not placeholder)
- Zod validation schemas
- React Hook Form field configurations
- TanStack Query response type annotations
- API request/response DTOs

### Input 6: HTML Mockup Screens (from mockup/ folder)

Read `<app_folder>/context/mockup/MOCKUP.html` first as the index page, then read the
HTML files organized by role in subfolders.

**MOCKUP.html** provides:
- Application identity (name, version, short name)
- Design tokens: fonts, colors from Tailwind/CSS config or inline styles
- List of user roles and their screen sets

**Role-specific subfolders** (e.g., `mockup/admin/content/`):
- Individual HTML screens for each page in the application
- Screen layout: which components are used (tables, forms, cards, modals, grids)
- Navigation structure from sidebar/header HTML files
- Data display patterns (list pages, detail pages, create/edit forms)

**IMPORTANT — Role folders inform access control, NOT URL paths.** The role-specific
folder structure (e.g., `mockup/admin/content/hero-section.html`) determines:
1. Which role can access the page → `<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="ADMIN" />`
2. Which navigation items appear for each role
It does NOT determine the URL path. The URL path is always module-based:
- `<Route path="/hero-section" />` — NOT `<Route path="/admin/hero-section" />`

The mockup screens directly map to:
- React page components (one per HTML screen)
- React Router route definitions
- MUI component selections (DataGrid vs Table, Dialog vs Drawer, etc.)
- Form field layouts
- Navigation items per role
- MUI theme color tokens (extract from mockup CSS/styles)

## Determining Optional Components

Instead of asking the user, the skill determines optional components by analyzing the
dependencies listed in `CLAUDE.md` and cross-referencing with PRD.md NFRs and constraints.

### Backend API Detection

Examine the "Depends on" list in CLAUDE.md for the target application:

| Dependency Pattern | API Configuration |
|---|---|
| References another application's REST API | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` set to that app's base URL |
| References a Spring Boot backend | Include Spring Boot CORS headers note |
| No explicit backend | Include mock API / json-server note for development |

### Authentication Detection

| Dependency / PRD Pattern | Auth Selection |
|---|---|
| References "Single Sign On" or "Keycloak" in CLAUDE.md dependencies | Auth = Keycloak |
| PRD.md has login user stories with email/password | Auth = Local (local JWT from API) |
| PRD.md constraint says "public access, no auth required" | Auth = none |
| PRD.md has only public-facing content (landing page) | Auth = none |

If Auth = Keycloak, also extract from CLAUDE.md:
- Keycloak version
- Keycloak realm: Default derived from project name
- Keycloak client ID: Default `<project-slug>-spa`
- Keycloak issuer URI: Default `http://localhost:8180/realms/<realm>`
- Keycloak roles: Infer from mockup role folders (e.g., `admin` → `ADMIN`, `editor` → `EDITOR`)

If Auth = Local (API-managed JWT):
- Login/logout handled by API calls to the backend
- JWT stored in memory (not localStorage) for XSS protection
- Axios interceptor attaches Authorization header
- Zustand auth store manages token and user info

### Optional Component Detection

| PRD.md Pattern | Component Selection |
|---|---|
| NFRs mention "grid", "sortable columns", "bulk select", "export CSV" | DataGrid = yes |
| NFRs mention "chart", "bar chart", "pie chart", "graph", "statistics" | Charts = yes |
| NFRs mention "date picker", "date range", "calendar" | DatePickers = yes |
| NFRs mention "real-time", "live updates", "push notification", "WebSocket" | WebSocket = yes |
| PRD.md mentions multiple languages or localization | i18n = yes |
| User stories mention "rich text", "WYSIWYG", "formatted content", "HTML content" | RichText = yes |

### Summary of Determination

After analyzing all inputs, produce a determination summary before generating the spec.
Present it to the user for confirmation:

```
Optional Component Determination:
- Backend API:    http://localhost:8080/api (from CLAUDE.md → depends on Admin API)
- Authentication: Keycloak PKCE (from CLAUDE.md → depends on Single Sign On)
- DataGrid:       yes (from PRD.md → NFR mentions sortable user list with bulk actions)
- Charts:         no
- DatePickers:    yes (from PRD.md → hero section effective/expiration date fields)
- WebSocket:      no
- i18n:           no
- RichText:       yes (from PRD.md → blog content editor requires rich text)
```

If the user disagrees with any determination, allow them to override before proceeding.

## Required Inputs

After determination, these values are needed. Most are derived automatically:

**Auto-derived from context files:**
- **Application name**: From CLAUDE.md section heading
- **Project slug**: Kebab-case of application name
- **App title**: Title-case used in `<title>` and MUI theme
- **Application description**: From CLAUDE.md description
- **Backend API base URL**: From CLAUDE.md dependencies
- **Modules / Features**: From PRD.md module headings + model/MODEL.md
- **Auth type**: Auto-determined (see above)
- **Optional components**: Auto-determined (see above)
- **User roles**: From mockup role folders
- **Design tokens**: MUI theme colors extracted from mockup CSS/inline styles

**Optional (use sensible defaults if not found in context):**
- **Dev server port**: Default `3000`
- **Default locale**: Default `en`
- **Page size**: Default `10` (from NFRs, or fallback)

## Generating the Specification

Once inputs are gathered from context files and optional components are determined,
generate the specification as a **multi-file output split by module**. Read the spec
template at `references/spec-template.md` for the exact structure and content of each
section. The template is the authoritative guide — follow it closely.

The specification is split into two categories:

1. **Root `SPECIFICATION.md`** — Table of Contents, shared infrastructure, MUI theme,
   routing, auth configuration, and application-level sections that apply across all modules.
2. **Per-module `<module-name>/SPEC.md`** — Each module gets its own folder with a
   self-contained specification covering that module's complete blueprint.

This split enables a coding agent to:
- First, scaffold the shared infrastructure from `SPECIFICATION.md`
- Then, implement each module independently by picking up its `<module>/SPEC.md`

**Important:** The generated spec must use **real module data** from the context files,
not generic placeholders. Specifically:

- **Modules** must use the actual module names from PRD.md and MODEL.md
  (e.g., `heroSection`, `productService`, `blog` — not `module1`, `module2`)
- **TypeScript types** must match the actual fields defined in the module model files,
  not placeholder `fieldOne`/`fieldTwo`
- **API hooks** must expose functions matching the actual user stories (e.g., if a story
  says "view list of hero sections", the hook needs `useHeroSections()`)
- **Page components** must map to the actual mockup screens (e.g., if
  `admin/content/hero_section.html` exists, there must be a matching route and page
  component). The route path is module-based (e.g., `/hero-section`), NOT role-prefixed
  (e.g., NOT `/admin/hero-section`).
- **Form fields** must match what the mockup screens display
- **Zod schemas** must enforce the constraints from PRD.md (character limits, URL format, etc.)
- **MUI theme** must use the design tokens extracted from the mockup (colors, border-radius, font)
- **Version tags**: Every user story ID, NFR ID, constraint ID, and mockup screen in the
  traceability section must include its version tag (e.g., `USA000030 [v1.0.4]`).
  **ALL traceability sub-tables (User Stories, NFRs, AND Constraints) MUST include the
  `| Version |` column.**
- **Removed / Replaced items**: The traceability section must include a "Removed / Replaced"
  subsection listing deprecated items — showing the removed ID, the version that removed it,
  the replacement ID (if any), and a brief reason.

### Output Structure

```
<app_folder>/context/specification/
├── SPECIFICATION.md                    ← TOC + shared/application-level specs
├── hero-section/
│   └── SPEC.md                         ← Module blueprint for Hero Section
├── product-service/

├── ...                                 ← One folder per module from PRD.md
```

### What Goes in `SPECIFICATION.md` (Root)

The root file contains the TOC and all shared/application-level sections. These are
sections a coding agent implements **first** before any module work:

#### 1. Project Overview
Project metadata, application description, technology stack summary, user roles, module
index table linking to each module's SPEC.md.

#### 2. Package Configuration
Complete `package.json` with all dependencies (core + selected conditional), npm scripts
(`dev`, `build`, `preview`, `lint`, `type-check`), and Vite configuration.

#### 3. Application Configuration
Vite `vite.config.ts` (with proxy for backend API), TypeScript `tsconfig.json`, ESLint
config. All environment-sensitive values use `VITE_` prefix in environment files.

#### 3a. Application Version Configuration
The application MUST include a version value exposed via Vite environment variable with a
default derived from the version argument provided during skill invocation. If multiple
versions were provided, use the highest one.

In `.env.development` and `.env.production`:
```properties
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.3
```

The application MUST expose this version in the **footer** of the layout. The shared layout
component (e.g., `src/components/Layout/Footer.tsx`) must read `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_VERSION`
and render it as: `v{version}` (e.g., `v1.0.3`).

The `package.json` `version` field MUST also be set to the version value (e.g., `1.0.3`).

#### 3b. `.env.development` File Generation from LOCAL.md
Generate `.env.development` and `.env.production` files at the project root.
The `.env.development` file is populated by reading `LOCAL.md` from the project root,
mapping credential and platform values to `VITE_`-prefixed environment variable names.
The `.env.production` file uses placeholder values for production deployment.

**Process:**
1. Read `LOCAL.md` from the project root
2. Extract relevant values from `# Credential` section (backend API host/port,
   Keycloak host/realm/client) and `# Platform` section (Node.js path)
3. Map each value to the corresponding `VITE_` environment variable name
4. Generate `.env.development` with actual local values
5. Generate `.env.production` with production placeholder values

**Example `.env.development` output (derived from LOCAL.md):**
```properties
# Backend API
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1

# Authentication (Keycloak)
VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8180
VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=urp
VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=sc-worker-mobile-spa
```

**Rules:**
- Only include variables that are actually used in the application code via `import.meta.env`
- Use actual values from LOCAL.md — never use placeholders or `TODO`
- If LOCAL.md does not exist or a value is not found, use sensible defaults for local
  development (e.g., `localhost`, default ports)
- Both `.env.development` and `.env.production` are gitignored

#### 4. Directory Structure
The complete source tree under `src/`. The structure follows feature-based architecture
where each PRD module maps to a `src/features/<module>/` folder.
Read `references/routing-patterns.md` for the module folder layout.

#### 5. MUI Theme Configuration
Custom MUI theme built from design tokens extracted from mockup screens. Includes color
palette (primary, secondary, error, warning, success), typography (font family, sizes),
shape (border-radius), and component overrides.
Read `references/component-patterns.md` for theme setup patterns.

#### 6. Authentication Configuration *(conditional — include only if Auth != none)*
**If Auth = Keycloak:** PKCE Authorization Code flow using `oidc-client-ts` +
`react-oidc-context`. `AuthProvider` wraps the app, `useAuth()` hook exposes user and
tokens, Axios interceptor attaches Bearer token, protected route component checks
authentication. Read `references/security-patterns.md` for the full auth architecture.

**If Auth = Local (API JWT):** Login form submits to backend API, JWT stored in Zustand
auth store (memory only, not localStorage), Axios interceptor attaches Authorization
header, token refresh interceptor handles 401 responses, protected route component
redirects unauthenticated users.

#### 7. Router Configuration
React Router v7 route tree — lazy-loaded page components, protected routes with role
guards, public routes, 404 fallback.
Read `references/routing-patterns.md` for route patterns.

#### 8. API Client Configuration
Axios instance with `baseURL` from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, request/response interceptors
for auth token injection, global error handling (toast notifications for 4xx/5xx),
request timeout.

#### 9. Global State (Zustand)
App-level Zustand stores: auth store (user info, token, login/logout actions), UI store
(sidebar open/closed, theme mode, global loading). Feature-level stores defined in each
module's SPEC.md.

#### 10. TanStack Query Setup
`QueryClient` configuration with sensible defaults (staleTime, gcTime, retry logic),
`QueryClientProvider` wrapping the app, React Query DevTools for development,
global error handler for failed queries.

#### 11. Shared Layouts
`DashboardLayout` (sidebar navigation + topbar + content area for authenticated pages),
`PublicLayout` (minimal header/footer for public pages), `AuthLayout` (centered card
for login/callback pages). Each layout uses MUI components.

#### 12. Shared Components
Reusable MUI-based components used across multiple modules: `PageHeader`, `DataTable`
(wrapper around MUI Table or X DataGrid), `ConfirmDialog`, `StatusChip`, `FormDialog`,
`ImageUpload`, `LoadingOverlay`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorBoundary`, `SearchInput`,
`FilterBar`. Each with TypeScript props interface.

#### 13. Navigation Configuration
Sidebar navigation items derived from mockup sidebar files, organized by role. Each item
has label, icon (MUI icon), path, and required role. Navigation is rendered dynamically
based on the authenticated user's roles.

#### 14. Form Infrastructure
`FormProvider` usage pattern from React Hook Form, Zod schema integration via
`zodResolver`, reusable controlled input components (`TextFieldController`,
`SelectController`, `DatePickerController`, `SwitchController`, `AutocompleteController`)
that wrap MUI inputs with RHF `Controller`.

#### 15. Error Handling Strategy
React `ErrorBoundary` component for rendering errors, Axios response interceptor for
API errors, TanStack Query `onError` callback for query failures, Zod validation error
message extraction utility, MUI Snackbar/Alert for user-facing error messages.

#### 16. Notification System
MUI Snackbar + Alert stack for toast notifications. Zustand notification store with
`push(type, message)` and `dismiss(id)` actions. `NotificationProvider` renders the
active queue at the bottom of the viewport.

#### 17. Theming & Dark Mode
MUI `ThemeProvider` with `CssBaseline`. Theme mode (`light`/`dark`) toggled via UI
control, persisted to `localStorage`. `useColorMode()` hook wraps the toggle action.
MUI `createTheme()` called with the extracted design tokens.

#### 18. Testing Strategy
Overview: Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/component tests, MSW (Mock Service
Worker) for API mocking in tests, Playwright for E2E tests. Per-feature test conventions
matching the module spec.

#### 19. Build & Deployment
Vite production build (`npm run build`), chunk splitting strategy (vendor chunk, per-
feature lazy chunks), environment variable injection, static hosting notes (nginx config
for SPA routing).

#### 20. Internationalisation *(conditional — include only if i18n = yes)*
`react-i18next` setup, `I18nextProvider` wrapping the app, lazy-loaded translation
namespaces per module (e.g., `heroSection.json`), `useTranslation()` hook usage pattern,
language switcher component.

#### 21. WebSocket Integration *(conditional — include only if WebSocket = yes)*
`socket.io-client` setup, connection management Zustand store, custom `useSocket()`
hook, event subscription patterns, reconnection handling.

### What Goes in Each `<module>/SPEC.md` (Per-Module)

For EACH module from PRD.md and MODEL.md, create a folder named after the module
(kebab-case, e.g., `hero-section/`) and generate a `SPEC.md` inside it.

Each module `SPEC.md` is a **self-contained** blueprint that a coding agent can pick up
and implement independently (after the shared infrastructure is in place). It must include:

- **Header** with module name and back-reference to root `SPECIFICATION.md`
- **Traceability**: User story IDs, NFR IDs, constraint IDs, table/collection names,
  mockup screen filenames, all with version tags
- **TypeScript Types** — interfaces/types matching the module model fields (field-for-field)
- **Zod Schemas** — validation schemas for create/update forms, derived from PRD constraints
- **API Functions** — Axios-based API calls matching user story data operations
- **TanStack Query Hooks** — `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks wrapping API functions
- **Zustand Feature Store** (if the module has complex client state beyond server cache)
- **Page Components** — one per mockup screen, using MUI components matching the mockup layout
- **Form Components** — create/edit forms with React Hook Form + Zod + MUI controllers
- **Route Definitions** — React Router routes for this module
- **Navigation Items** — sidebar nav entries for each role that can access this module
- **Complete code samples** for every component — continuous and copy-pasteable

See `references/spec-template.md` for the exact per-module template structure.

## Changelog Append

After all specification files are successfully generated, append an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root:

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` from the project root. If it does not exist, create it with:
   ```markdown
   # Changelog

   - This file tracks all skill executions by version across all applications.
   - The highest version recorded here is the current project version.
   - Skills MUST NOT execute for a version lower than the highest version in this file.

   ---
   ```
2. Search for a `## {version}` heading matching the current version.
3. If the section **exists**: append a new row to its table.
4. If the section **does not exist**: insert a new section after the `---` below the context header and before any existing `## vX.Y.Z` section (newest-first ordering), with a new table header and the first row.
5. Row format: `| {YYYY-MM-DD} | {application_name} | specgen-react-mui | {module or "All"} | Generated React SPA technical specification |`
6. **Never modify or delete existing rows.**

## Output Format

The generated specification is a **folder of files**, not a single document:

```
<app_folder>/context/specification/
├── SPECIFICATION.md                    ← Root: TOC + shared/application-level specs
├── <module-1>/
│   └── SPEC.md                         ← Module blueprint (self-contained)
├── <module-2>/
│   └── SPEC.md
├── <module-N>/
│   └── SPEC.md
```

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

These constraints apply to every code sample in the generated spec:

**TypeScript everywhere.** All files use `.tsx` or `.ts` extensions. No `.js` or `.jsx`.
No `any` type — use `unknown` with type narrowing, or proper type inference.

**Feature-based architecture.** Every module maps to `src/features/<module>/`. Nothing
module-specific leaks into `src/shared/` or `src/lib/`. Shared utilities must be
genuinely reusable across at least two modules.

**No localStorage for tokens.** JWT access tokens are stored in Zustand memory store
only. Refresh tokens may use `httpOnly` cookies (handled by backend). This prevents XSS
token theft.

**TanStack Query for all server state.** Do not use Zustand or component state to cache
API responses. TanStack Query manages all server-side data (fetching, caching, invalidation).
Zustand manages only client-side UI state (filters, selections, modal open/closed).

**React Hook Form + Zod for all forms.** Do not use uncontrolled inputs or manual
`useState` for form fields. Every form uses `useForm()` with `zodResolver()`.

**MUI components only.** Do not mix component libraries. If a component is not
natively available in MUI, build it using MUI primitives (`Box`, `Stack`, `Typography`,
`Paper`). No Tailwind CSS in this skill (unlike the Spring Boot / Laravel skills).

**Named exports for components.** Use named exports (not default exports) for all
component files to improve tree-shaking and refactoring.

**Lazy loading for all page components.** All route page components use `React.lazy()`
for code splitting. The router uses `<Suspense>` with a loading fallback.

**Consistent file naming:**
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `HeroSectionList.tsx`)
- Hooks: `camelCase.ts` with `use` prefix (e.g., `useHeroSections.ts`)
- API functions: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `heroSectionApi.ts`)
- Types: `camelCase.types.ts` (e.g., `heroSection.types.ts`)
- Zod schemas: `camelCase.schema.ts` (e.g., `heroSection.schema.ts`)
- Zustand stores: `camelCase.store.ts` (e.g., `heroSection.store.ts`)
